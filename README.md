# Udemy Angular class assignment 2: Databinding practice
I made a component called server that is rendered by the app. The server component has an input field to type into, where two way binding is used to ensure the contents of the input box match the username variable in teh component. The username is displayed in a p tag. There is also a button that is disabled if the length of the username string is 0, otherwise is can be clicked to reset the username box to be empty

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
